<p><strong>Founding Engineer @Gritt Robotics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Previously, Senior Software Engineer @Aurora, PhD in Robotics @CMU, CS @IITB</strong></p>
<p>Anirudh is a founding engineer at <a href="https://www.gritt.ai/">Gritt Robotics</a>. He is on a mission to automate outdoor construction using Robotics and AI, specifically focusing on clean energy infrastructure. He is passionate about using AI to make a positive impact on climate change.</p>
<p>Previously, Anirudh was a senior software engineer at <a href="https://aurora.tech/">Aurora</a> where he led the development of a production-level ML pipeline for learning the AV motion planner with human feedback, including data extraction, and large scale labeling and training.</p>
<p>In the distant past, Anirudh was a graduate student in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. He worked with <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/maxim-likhachev/">Maxim Likhachev</a> and <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/j-andrew-drew-bagnell/">Drew Bagnell</a> on research areas at the intersection of planning and learning. He was supported by CMU Presidential Fellowship. You can find his thesis <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/planning-and-execution-using-inaccurate-models-with-provable-guarantees-on-task-completeness/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anirudh tries to make robots <span style="color:#DB4437"> <em>move</em>, <em>grasp</em>, <em>think</em> and <em>plan</em>. </span> He fails often but every once in a while, he stumbles onto <a href="../research">something</a>.
When not doing aforementioned, he can be seen</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>biking</strong> - he has completed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Allegheny_Passage">GAP</a> and <a href="https://www.canaltrust.org/plan/co-canal-towpath/">C&amp;O</a> bike trail from Pittsburgh to DC (333.3 miles)</li>
<li><strong>hiking</strong> - he is adept at <a href="https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13784/how-can-i-clear-spiderwebs-in-my-path-while-hiking">avoiding spider webs</a></li>
<li><strong>climbing</strong> - he knows when to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bouldering/comments/41v1cv/when_to_rotate_your_hips_into_the_wall/">rotate his hips</a></li>
</ul>
